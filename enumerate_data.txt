Bite 15. Enumerate 2 sequences

    Iterate over the given names and countries lists,
    printing them prepending the number of the loop (starting at 1).
    Here is the output you need to deliver:

    1. Julian     Australia
    2. Bob        Spain
    3. PyBites    Global
    4. Dante      Argentina
    5. Martin     USA
    6. Rodolfo    Mexico

    Notice that the 2nd column should have a fixed width of 11 chars,
    so between Julian and Australia there are 5 spaces,
    between Bob and Spain, there are 8.
    This column should also be aligned to the left.

    Ideally you use only one for loop, but that is not a requirement.

    Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
