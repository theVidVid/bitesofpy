Bite 109. Workout dictionary lookups
===============================================================================

In this Bite you learn how to lookup values from a dictionary 
or in Python: dict.

You are presented with WORKOUT_SCHEDULE dict (constant) with 
keys = days and values = workouts (or rest up). 

Complete get_workout_motd that receives a day string, 
title case it so the function can receive case insensitive days, 
look it up in the dict and do two things:

If the day (key) is not in the dictionary, return INVALID_DAY, 
we don't want this function to continue.

If the key is in the dictionary, return CHILL_OUT or TRAIN depending if 
it's a REST day or not. 

The latter you will need to string-interpolate using format.

Also check out the docstring and tests. 
Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!

Update 25th of Nov 2019: previously this Bite required re-raising the KeyError, 
but as that's already the default behavior of a missing key in a dict, 
we changed the requirements to return a value instead.
