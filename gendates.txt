Bite 16. PyBites date generator

    Write a generator that returns the following "special" dates
    (datetime objects) for PyBites:

    - Our birthday! What is the date every year going forward from the PYBITES_BORN date
    (datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 19, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2018, 12, 19, 0, 0), ...)?

    - Return every 100th day counting forward from the PYBITES_BORN date
    (datetime(2017, 3, 29, 0, 0), datetime(2017, 7, 7, 0, 0), ...)

    As this is a beginner challenge we're only calculating/ testing a few years ahead of the
    PYBITES_BORN date.

    This will omit the next leap year (2020) from the challenge making it a
    bit easier for you (we will revisit this in an intermediate challenge). Have fun!
